# Introduction
With rising crime rates globally, law enforcement agencies face increasingly complex challenges in maintaining public safety. Traditional policing methods, while still essential, often fall short in responding swiftly to dynamic and evolving criminal activities. This case study explores how leveraging advanced technologies and crime data analysis can revolutionize law enforcement efforts in a major city, optimizing crime prevention, response, and resource allocation. This futher highlights the critical role that data analysis can play in modern policing and provides a framework for other cities looking to enhance their law enforcement efforts in the face of rising crime rates.







# Problem Statement
In recent years, the surge in crime rates has posed significant challenges for law enforcement agencies. Traditional policing methods struggle to keep pace with the evolving nature of criminal activities, leading to inefficiencies in crime prevention, resource allocation, and response times. The lack of real-time data-driven insights further complicates decision-making processes, hindering law enforcementâ€™s ability to proactively address potential threats. The successful completion of this project will equip the police department to make more informed decisions, significantly enhancing crime prevention and law enforcement efficiency. This shift not only modernizes traditional policing methods but also highlights the importance of a proactive, data-driven strategy in tackling the evolving challenges of urban crime.

# Data modeling
Key dimensions for breaking down the analysis were identified, leading to the creation of new tables corresponding to each dimension. These include the following tables:
- Location Dimennsion
- Date Dimension
- Offense Dimension
- Crimefact Table
-  Metrix Table
  The data model was structured using a Star Schema, where multiple dimension tables were linked to the central Fact table through one-to-many relationships.
